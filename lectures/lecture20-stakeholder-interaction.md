## Stakeholder Interaction

* We've talked lots about the "hard science" aspect of engineering, but just as - if not more - important are soft skills

* You will often be at odds with fellow developers, managers, testers, customers, etc.
  * Need to learn to discuss in a calm, rational way
  * Conflict resolution

* Software development is more social than you might think!
  * How are your teams communicating?  Slack, HipChat, Google Chat, Google Hangouts, etc.
  * Communication is vital for reasons I think you will find clear

* People skills can be learned!

* When you start working, try to figure out...
  * To whom should I talk about a problem?
  * When is it appropriate to talk about it? Should you RTFM first?
  * How do I discuss things with different team members (e.g., management vs individual contributors, technical vs non-technical)?
  * How should I use CYA documentation?
  * How to push back?  Different places have different cultures

* What is a stakeholder?
  * A person or group who has an interest in the completion and/or execution of the system under development
  * This term is used not just in software, but other fields as well

* Example stakeholders (not a complete list):
  * Customers - people who pay for the system
  * Users - The people who actually use the system (not always the same as the customer)
  * Project managers- people who managing the project to completion
  * Upper management - The people who care about the financial ROI of the product or how it impacts the bottom line
  * Developers - The people who write and maintain the software
  * Quality Assurance - People who test the software and ensure quality
  * Support staff - sysadmins, help desk, customer support, etc.
  * Assessors - The people who oversee the legal and regulatory aspects of a system
  * A stakeholder has a DIRECT impact on the system, not indirect (e.g. baristas serve more coffee because more people working more hours and need more coffee)

* When making decisions, poll stakeholders

* More communication - as long as it's well-crafted - better than less

* Engage  early, engage often.  If you are trying to figure out whether or not you should communicate, do so.
  * Engage does not just mean "communicate".  Listen.
  * Give the stakeholders a chance to let you know their opinion

* For software developers, big split is often between technical and non-technical personnel

* Speak language of the stakeholders
  * Developers -> terms of technology
  * Testers -> terms of quality
  * Project Managers -> terms of scope and deadlines
  * Upper Management -> terms of financials
  * etc.
  * Care enough to know what they care about!

* Be explicit about problems, benefits, drawbacks
  * Let stakeholders know of problems early
  * Be clear and concise
  * UPOD (underpromise, overdeliver)
  * Manage expectations
  * Identify and manage risks
    * You can mitigate risk but never totally avoid it

* Interacting with other technical personnel is often simpler, because you share a common frame of reference.
  * When interacting with others, think what their frame of reference is
  * Try to speak their language

* The Red-Yellow-Green template for dealing with management

* Big issue: respect.
