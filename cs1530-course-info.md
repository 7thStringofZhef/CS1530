**

This course provides students with a broad understanding of modern software engineering. Although it will cover theory, the emphasis is on providing practical skills in software engineering currently used in industry. To that end, it will cover project and product management, software architecture and design patterns, team communications, and other material relevant to __engineering__ software instead of just __coding__ it.

## Grading

* Mid-term Exam - 10%
* Final Exam - 15%
* Group Project:
  * Sprint 1 Deliverable - 10%
  * Sprint 2 Deliverable - 10% 
  * Sprint 3 Deliverable - 10%
  * Final Deliverable - 20%
* Class Participation - 15% (incl. Exercises)
* Lightning Talk - 10%

It is strongly recommended that you come to class each for each lecture.  Material may be presented or covered in class that is not in the reading.  I also expect active participation in class (there will be various projects done in class).

The syllabus is subject to modification, as the interests and abilities of the class are gauged.

The following grading scale will be used.

Score  | Grade
-----: | ------------------------------
100-94 | A (A+ for extraordinary work)
93-91  | A-
90-88  | B+
87-84  | B
83-81  | B-
80-78  | C+
77-74  | C
73-71  | C-
70-68  | D+
67-64  | D
63-61  | D-
60-0   | F

All groups are expected to do their own work on the group project, but
are more than welcome to collaborate and ask questions with other
groups, the Internet, or other colleagues.

However, any student caught collaborating or cheating on an exam will
automatically receive a 0 (zero) for that exam, and may be penalized
more harshly based on University of Pittsburgh academic policy.

The final exam will be cumulative.

It is recommended you keep all of your graded assignments until final
grades are posted and accepted, in order to resolve any discrepancies
in grading.

## Attendance

Presence for the mid-term and final exam are REQUIRED.  They will be
individually re-scheduled only in the event of an emergency.  If you
are facing an emergency, please contact the instructor IMMEDIATELY (if
it is safe to do so, of course).  Failure to show up for an exam
without clearing it first with the instructor will result in a 0
(zero) for that exam.

## Group Project Details

Students will be grouped into groups of 4 or 5, and will work on a project of their choosing (authorized by the instructor) for the duration of the course.  There will be several sprints, at the end of each of which the students will have a working version of their software available on Github, as well as documentation and other information (specified for each particular sprint).

Deliverables must be committed to Github by the beginning of class on the day that it is due.  Late deliverables will NOT be accepted unless authorized __at least 24 hours before the due date__.

## Lightning Talk
All students will give a 5 minute presentation on an aspect of software engineering not covered by the course.  This should be something relevant and not familiar to other students in the class.  The talk should be aimed at peers; it is not to be an academic paper, but a way of explaining something interesting to the class.

Good examples include:
* An interesting algorithm
* Differences between programming paradigms (e.g., functional vs imperative)
* A design pattern not covered in class
* An introduction to another programming language
* Using a tool
* An introduction to an IDE or editor (e.g. Emacs or vim)
* An analysis of the architecture of a company
* A critique of how your experience differs from what you've learned in class (this one or others)

Bonus points will be given if the talk is also presented at a programming meetup or conference.

## Programming Language Selection

All software projects for this course will be done in the Java language and tested with JUnit.

If you want to use Java but aren't a fan of Eclipse, information on setting up the [Gradle build tool](https://gradle.org/) with the required packages for this course can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/alexlafroscia/c6757de349b27e34eff6).  

## Disability Services Statement

"The Office of Disability Resources and
Services (DRS) provides a broad range of support services to assist
students with disabilities. Services include, but are not limited to,
tape-recorded textbooks, sign language interpreters, adaptive and
transportation. Contact DRS at 412-648-7890 or 412-383-1355 (TTY) in
216 William Pitt Union or see www.drs.pitt.edu for more computer
technology, Braille translation, and nonstandard exam arrangements,
DRS can also assist students with accessibility to campus housing
information."

## Academic Integrity Statement

"As members of the University of
Pittsburgh community, A&S students are expected to meet the obligation
to exhibit honesty and to respect the ethical standards of the
University community and of their chosen field of study in carrying
out academic assignments. A&S students are therefore expected to
familiarize themselves with the published rules and regulations go to
